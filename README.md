About
-----

cs is a compiler cache. It speeds up recompilation by caching the result of
previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done
again. Supported languages are C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++.

History
-------

cs is based on ccache.

ccache was originally written by Andrew Tridgell and is currently developed and
maintained by Joel Rosdahl. ccache started out as a reimplementation of Erik
Thiele's ``compilercache'' (see http://www.erikyyy.de/compilercache/) in C.
