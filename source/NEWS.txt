ccache 3.1.8
------------
Release date: 2012-08-11


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Made paths to dependency files relative in order to increase cache hits.
    - Added work-around to make ccache work with buggy GCC 4.1 when creating a
      pre-compiled header.
    - Clang plugins are now hashed to catch plugin upgrades.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - Fixed crash when the current working directory has been removed.
    - Fixed crash when stderr is closed.
    - Corrected a corner case when parsing backslash escapes in string
      literals.
    - Paths are now correctly canonicalized when computing paths relative to
      the base directory.


Other
~~~~~

    - Made git version macro work when compiling outside of the source
      directory.
    - Fixed `static_assert` macro definition clash with GCC 4.7.


ccache 3.1.7
------------
Release date: 2012-01-08


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - Non-writable `CCACHE_DIR` is now handled gracefully when
      `CCACHE_READONLY` is set.
    - Made failure to create files (typically due to bad directory permissions)
      in the cache directory fatal. Previously, such failures were silently and
      erroneously flagged as "compiler produced stdout".
    - Both the `-specs=file` and `--specs=file` forms are now recognized.
    - Added recognition and hashing of GCC plugins specified with
      `-fplugin=file`.
    - `CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK` now also determines how to hash explicit specs
      files (`-specs=file`).
    - Added `CPATH`, `C_INCLUDE_PATH` and similar environment variables to the
      hash to avoid false cache hits when such variables have changed.
    - Corrected log message when unify mode is enabled.
    - Reverted the GCC bug compatibility introduced in ccache 3.1.5 for
      `-MT`/`-MQ` options with concatenated arguments. (The bug is fixed in
      recent GCC versions.)


Other
~~~~~

    - Corrected license header for `mdfour.c`.
    - Improved documentation on how to fix bad object files in the cache.



ccache 3.1.6

    - Rewrite argument to `--sysroot` if `CCACHE_BASEDIR` is used.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - Don't crash if `getcwd()` fails.
    - Fixed alignment of ``called for preprocessing'' counter.


ccache 3.1.5
------------
Release date: 2011-05-29


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Added a new statistics counter named ``called for preprocessing''.
    - The original command line is now logged to the file specified with
      `CCACHE_LOGFILE`.
    - Improved error logging when system calls fail.
    - Added support for rewriting absolute paths in `-F`/`-iframework` GCC
      options.
    - Improved order of statistics counters in `ccache -s` output.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - The `-MF`/`-MT`/`-MQ` options with concatenated argument are now handled
      correctly when they are last on the command line.
    - ccache is now bug compatible with GCC for the `-MT`/`-MQ` options with
      concatenated arguments.
    - Fixed a minor memory leak.
    - Systems that lack (and don't need to be linked with) libm are now
      supported.


ccache 3.1.4

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - Made a work-around for a bug in gzputc() in zlib 1.2.5.

    - Corrupt manifest files are now removed so that they won't block direct
      mode hits.

    - ccache now copes with file systems that don't know about symbolic links.

    - The file handle in now correctly closed on write error when trying to
      create a cache dir tag.


ccache 3.1.3
------------
Release date: 2010-11-28


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - The -MFarg, -MTarg and -MQarg compiler options (i.e, without space
      between option and argument) are now handled correctly.


Other
~~~~~

    - Portability fixes for HP-UX 11.00 and other esoteric systems.


ccache 3.1.2
------------
Release date: 2010-11-21


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - Bail out on too hard compiler options `-fdump-*`.

    - NULL return values from malloc/calloc of zero bytes are now handled
      correctly.

    - Fixed issue when parsing precompiler output on AIX.


Other
~~~~~

    - Improved documentation on which information is included in the hash sum.

    - Made the ``too new header file'' test case work on file systems with
      unsynchronized clocks.

    - The test suite now also works on systems that lack a /dev/zero.


ccache 3.1.1
------------
Release date: 2010-11-07


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - ccache now falls back to preprocessor mode when a non-regular include
      file (device, socket, etc) has been detected so that potential hanging
      due to blocking reads is avoided.

    - CRC errors are now detected when decompressing compressed files in the
      cache.

    - Fixed potential object file corruption race on NFS.

    - Minor documentation corrections.

    - Fixed configure detection of ar.

    - ccache development version (set by dev.mk) now works with gits whose
      `describe` command doesn't understand `--dirty`.


Other
~~~~~

    - Minor debug log message improvements.


ccache 3.1
----------
Release date: 2010-09-16

New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Added support for hashing the output of a custom command (e.g.
      `%compiler% --version`) to identify the compiler instead of stat-ing or
      hashing the compiler binary. This can improve robustness when the
      compiler (as seen by ccache) actually isn't the real compiler but another
      compiler wrapper.

    - Added support for caching compilations that use precompiled headers. (See
      the manual for important instructions regarding this.)

    - Locking of the files containing statistics counters is now done using
      symlinks instead of POSIX locks. This should make ccache behave a lot
      better on file systems where POSIX locks are slow or broken (e.g. NFS on
      some systems).

    - Manifest files are now updated without the need of taking locks.

    - Updates of statistics counters are now always done in one of the
      sub-level statistics files. This reduces lock contention, which
      especially improves performance on slow NFS mounts.

    - Reading and writing of statistics counters has been made
      forward-compatible (unknown counters are retained).

    - Files are now read without using mmap(). This has two benefits: it's more
      robust against file changes during reading and it improves performance on
      poor systems where mmap() doesn't use the disk cache.

    - Added `.cp` and `.CP` as known C++ suffixes.

    - Improved logging.

    - Added `-install_name` as an option known to take an argument. (This
      improves statistics when using the Darwin linker.)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - Non-fatal error messages are now never printed to stderr but logged
      instead.

    - Fixed a bug affecting failing commands when `--ccache-skip` is used.

    - Made `--ccache-skip` work for all options.

    - EINTR is now handled correctly.


Other
~~~~~

    - Work on porting ccache to win32 (native), mostly done by Ramiro Polla.
      The port is not yet finished, but will hopefully be complete in some
      subsequent release.

    - Added a `--nostats` flag to the performance benchmark program.

    - Made the performance benchmark program more accurate when measuring cache
      hits.

    - Added a new test framework for unit tests written in C.

    - Got rid of `configure-dev`; dev mode is now given by `dev.mk.in`
      presence.

    - Improved documentation on how to combine ccache with other compiler
      wrappers (like `distcc`).

    - New `LICENSE.txt` file with licensing and copyright details about bundled
      source code.

    - New `AUTHORS.txt` file with a list of ccache contributors.

    - New `HACKING.txt` file with some notes about ccache code conventions.


ccache 3.0.1
------------
Release date: 2010-07-15

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - The statistics counter ``called for link'' is now correctly updated when
      linking with a single object file.
    - Fixed a problem with out-of-source builds.


ccache 3.0
----------
Release date: 2010-06-20

General
~~~~~~~

    - ccache is now licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version
      3 or later.


Upgrade notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - The way the hashes are calculated has changed, so you won't get cache
      hits for compilation results stored by older ccache versions. Because of
      this, you might as well clear the old cache directory with `ccache
      --clear` if you want, unless you plan to keep using an older ccache
      version.


New features and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - ccache now has a ``direct mode'' where it computes a hash of the source
      code (including all included files) and compiler options without
      running the preprocessor. By not running the preprocessor, CPU usage is
      reduced; the speed is somewhere between 1 and 5 times that of ccache
      running in traditional mode, depending on the circumstances. The speedup
      will be higher when I/O is fast (e.g., when files are in the disk cache).
      The direct mode can be disabled by setting +CCACHE_NODIRECT+.

    - Support has been added for rewriting absolute paths to relative paths
      when hashing, in order to increase cache hit rate when building the same
      source code in different directories even when compiling with `-g` and
      when using absolute include directory paths. This is done by setting the
      `CCACHE_BASEDIR` environment variable to an absolute path that specifies
      which paths to rewrite.

    - Object files are now optionally stored compressed in the cache. The
      runtime cost is negligible, and more files will fit in the ccache
      directory and in the disk cache. Set `CCACHE_COMPRESS` to enable object
      file compression. Note that you can't use compression in combination with
      the hard link feature.

    - A `CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK` option has been added. This option tells ccache
      what compiler-identifying information to hash to ensure that results
      retrieved from the cache are accurate. Possible values are: none (don't
      hash anything), mtime (hash the compiler's mtime and size) and content
      (hash the content of the compiler binary). The default is mtime.

    - It is now possible to specify extra files whose contents should be
      included in the hash sum by setting the `CCACHE_EXTRAFILES` option.

    - Added support for Objective-C and Objective-C\+\+. The statistics counter
      ``not a C/C++ file'' has been renamed to ``unsupported source language''.

    - Added support for the `-x` compiler option.

    - Added support for long command-line options.

    - A `CACHEDIR.TAG` file is now created in the cache directory. See
      <http://www.brynosaurus.com/cachedir/>.

    - Messages printed to the debug log (specified by `CCACHE_LOGFILE`) have
      been improved.

    - You can relax some checks that ccache does in direct mode by setting
      `CCACHE_SLOPPINESS`. See the manual for more information.

    - `CCACHE_TEMPDIR` no longer needs to be on the same filesystem as
      `CCACHE_DIR`.

    - The default value of `CCACHE_TEMPDIR` has been changed to
      `$CCACHE_DIR/tmp` to avoid cluttering the top directory.

    - Temporary files that later will be moved into the cache are now created
      in the cache directory they will end up in. This makes ccache more
      friendly to Linux's directory layout.

    - Improved the test suite and added tests for most of the new
      functionality. It's now also possible to specify a subset of tests to
      run.

    - Standard error output from the compiler is now only stored in the cache
      if it's non-empty.

    - If the compiler produces no object file or an empty object file, but
      gives a zero exit status (could be due to a file system problem, a buggy
      program specified by `CCACHE_PREFIX`, etc.), ccache copes with it
      properly.

    - Added `installcheck` and `distcheck` make targets.

    - Clarified cache size limit options' and cleanup semantics.

    - Improved display of cache max size values.

    - The following options are no longer hashed in the preprocessor mode:
      `-imacros`, `-imultilib`, `-iprefix`, `-iquote`, `-isysroot`,
      `-iwithprefix`, `-iwithprefixbefore`, `-nostdinc`, `-nostdinc++` and
      `-U`.


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

    - Various portability improvements.

    - Improved detection of home directory.

    - User-defined `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` are now respected in the Makefile.

    - Fixed NFS issues.

    - Computation of the hash sum has been improved to decrease the risk of
      hash collisions. For instance, the compiler options `-X -Y` and `-X-Y`
      previously contributed equally to the hash sum.

    - Bail out on too hard compiler options `--coverage`, `-fprofile-arcs`,
      `-fprofile-generate`, `-fprofile-use`, `-frepo`, `-ftest-coverage` and
      `-save-temps`. Also bail out on `@file` style options.

    - Errors when using multiple `-arch` compiler options are now noted as
      ``unsupported compiler option''.

    - `-MD`/`-MMD` options without `-MT`/`-MF` are now handled correctly.

    - The `-finput-charset` option is now handled correctly.

    - Added support for `-Wp,-MD` and `-Wp,-MMD` options.

    - The compiler options `-Xassembler`, `-b`, `-G` and `-V` are now correctly
      recognized as taking an argument.

    - Debug information containing line numbers of predefined and command-line
      macros (enabled with the compiler option `-g3`) will now be correct.

    - Corrected LRU cleanup handling of object files.

    - `utimes()` is now used instead of `utime()` when available.

    - Non-writable cache directories are now handled gracefully.

    - Corrected documentation about sharing the cache directory.

    - Fixed compilation warnings from GCC 4.3.

    - The command specified by `CCACHE_PREFIX` is no longer part of the hash.

    - Fixed bad memory access spotted by Valgrind.

    - Fixed a bug in `x_realloc`.

    - Freed memory is no longer referenced when compiling a `.i`/`.ii` file and
      falling back to running the real compiler.

    - The test suite is now immune to external values of the `CCACHE_*`
      environment variables.

    - Improved detection of recursive invocation.

    - The ccache binary is now not unconditionally stripped when installing.

    - Statistics counters are now correctly updated for -E option failures and
      internal errors.
